Administrative Stuff
- plan features for 4.0
- add as many translatable strings as possible for 4.0+ versions
- ask all translators for new translation after implementation and before release

Features

Feature 1
- add separate option for "jquery-colorbox-auto.js"

Feature 2
- add separate options for "add colorbox to galleries" and "add colorbox to images"

Feature 3
- add possibility for custom themes
    - rename themes to have a leading zero

Feature 4
- add possibility to use a custom JavaScript file instead of inline JavaScript for colorbox


Still in question
- add option to switch colorbox off for whole posts and pages
