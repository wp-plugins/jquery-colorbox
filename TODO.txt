Need to think about these features
- add link to Fullscreen to Colorbox
(http://groups.google.com/group/colorbox/browse_thread/thread/6d28c99111051f41/8505ab852396c500?lnk=gst&q=fullscreen#8505ab852396c500)

- display description/caption when mouse is hovering on the image
(http://groups.google.com/group/colorbox/browse_thread/thread/4d4d5a02daa85ce9/1fcb9056d993a6e5?lnk=gst&q=description#1fcb9056d993a6e5)
    - big question: how do I get the description/caption in the JavaScript?

- add option to switch colorbox off for whole posts and pages
