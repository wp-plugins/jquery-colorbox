Adds Colorbox/Lightbox functionality to images on the blog. Images are grouped by post or page. Also works on WordPress galleries.

== Description ==

Yet another Colorbox plugin for Wordpress.

When adding an image to a post or page, usually a thumbnail is inserted and linked to the image in original size.
All images in posts and pages can be displayed in a layer when the thumbnail is clicked.
Images are grouped as galleries when linked in the same post or page. Groups can be displayed in an automatic slideshow.

Images can be excluded by giving them a special CSS class.

See the <a href="http://www.techotronic.de/index.php/plugins/jquery-colorbox/">plugin page</a> for demo pages.

Includes <a href="http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/">ColorBox</a> 1.3.6 jQuery plugin from Jack Moore. Colorbox is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.
jQuery Colorbox uses the jQuery library version 1.3.2 bundled with Wordpress. Should work with jQuery 1.4 too.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* I have installed and activated (or updated) jQuery Colorbox, but it doesn't show up when I click on a thumbnail in my blog. Is the plugin broken?

Since version 2.0, jQuery Colorbox' automatic behaviour can be switched on and off in the settings. That way, you can apply the Colorbox functionality manually to single images.

The default ist OFF.

* How does jQuery Colorbox work?

When inserting a picture, the field "Link URL" needs to contain the link to the full-sized image. (press the button "Link to Image" below the field)
When rendering the blog, a special CSS class ("colorbox-postId", e.g. "colorbox-123") is added to linked images.
This CSS class is then passed to the colorbox JavaScript.

* How do I exclude an image from Colorbox in a page or post?

Add the CSS class "colorbox-off" to the image you want to exclude.
jQuery Colorbox does not add the colorbox effect to images that have the CSS class "colorbox-off".

* How does jQuery Colorbox group images?

For all images in a post or page, the same CSS class is added. All images with the same CSS class are grouped.

* I have Flash (e.g. Youtube videos) embedded on my website. Why do they show up over the layer when I click on an image?

This is a Flash issue, but relatively easy to solve. Just activate the automatic hiding of embedded flash objects on the settings page.

Adobe described on these sites what the problem is and how to fix it:
<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15523.html">Adobe Knowledgebase 1</a>
<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/142/tn_14201.html">Adobe Knowledgebase 2</a>

* I installed your plugin, but when I click on a thumbnail, the original picture is loaded directly instead of in the Colorbox. What could be the problem?

Tricky.

I have seen problems where other plugins include older, incompatible versions of the jQuery library my plugin uses.
Since I include the jQuery library in a non-conflicting way, the other jQuery library is usually loaded.

Maybe the images you want jQuery Colorbox to work on are added by a plugin and the images are added after jQuery Colorbox manipulates the HTML when rendering your blog.

Sometimes I have seen Images without the "class" attribute. If there is no "class" attribute present in the IMG-Tag, jQuery Colorbox can't add the necessary CSS class and won't work on that image.

* Why is jQuery Colorbox not available in my language?

I speak German and English fluently, but unfortunately no other language well enough to do a translation.

Would you like to help? Translating the plugin is easy if you understand English and are fluent in another language.

* My question isn't answered here. What do I do now?

Feel free to write an email to blog [at] techotronic.de or write a entry at <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/jquery-colorbox?forum_id=10">the jQuery Colorbox WordPress.org forum</a>.

I'll include new FAQs in every new version. Promise.
